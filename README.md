**Getting Started**
  Prerequisites:-
  To run the website locally, you need the following:
  -  A web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
  -  Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

  Installation
  -  Clone the repository (or download the files):

          git clone https://github.com/A-YSoftTech/Frontend-Calculators
     
  -  Navigate to the project folder:

          cd calculators.html
     
  -  Open the calculators.html file in your browser:
      Double-click on calculators.html or
      Right-click and select "Open with" -> Your web browser.
    Now, your website should be running locally.

**File Structure**
  -  calculators.html: The main HTML file, containing the structure of the website and all the calculator sections.
  -  calculators.css: The CSS file that contains all the styles used to design the website.

**How It Works**
  -  Each section in the calculators.html file corresponds to a specific calculator.
